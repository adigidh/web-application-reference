# Web Performance

In today’s fast paced digital age, first impressions are everything. The speed at which user experiences are perceived on a user’s end are very crucial for conversion rates and user retention. In our development experiences, we have observed web performance to be one of the most important aspects of building a successful site or a web application. If a webapp or a site has poor performance, it tends to provide a negative user experience thereby impacting in lost business, customers or users. On the other hand, a higher-performance and more responsive app leads to a better user experience which is key in gaining and keeping users. Our prior digital experiences have confirmed that web application performance can directly influence revenue, time spent on the site, page views, search traffic, and user retention.

Developers at IBM and Red Hat have incorporated a Web Performance Culture that is focussed on prioritizing speed, visual stability and efficiency. A combination of these factors helps alleviating bounce rates, improving conversions, and in turn enhancing user satisfaction. From our own experiences, involves collaborative development at the intersection of content management, frontend, backend and the network layer. Based on the research done at IBM and Red Hat and reviewing the discussions of the W3C Web Performance Working Group, we’ve summarized the important metrics to measure below. 

Although "slow" and "fast" are very subjective per user, studies in human-computer interactions and feedback from UXR studies done in IBM & Red Hat have provided us with some general rule of thumb numbers:

- Up to 250ms, everything feels instant.
- Up to 750ms, UI feels rapid, with short loading animation which becomes noticeable.
- Up to 1500ms, loading animation is heavily dominant in the page perception, but page still feels usable.
- Above 3 seconds, 70% of the people will start avoiding the UI if they can.
- Over 5 seconds, your application is considered 'broken' or unusable.
